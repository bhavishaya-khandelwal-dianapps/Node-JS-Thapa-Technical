//*=======================================
//* What is Node JS ?
//*=======================================
//? It is open source, server-side JavaScript Runtime.

//? Allows you to run JavaScript on your machine or servers. 

//? Built on the V8 JavaScript for speed.

//? Robust ecosystem with npm 







//*=======================================
//* What is Open Source ?
//*=======================================
//? Open Source means that the source code of Node.js is publicly available. 

//? Anyone can :- 
    //* View : You can see how Node.js is built under the hood .
    
    //* Modify : If you want to customize or improve Node.js, you can do it. 

    //* Contribute : Developers around the world actively contribute to improving Node.js







//*=======================================
//* What is Cross-Platform ?
//*=======================================
//? Cross platform means Node.js can run on multiple operating systems without needing major changes. 
//* Windows, MAC, Linux 








//*=======================================
//* What is JavaScript Runtime Environment ?
//*=======================================
//? JavaScript runtime environment refers to the environment where your JavaScript code runs. 

//* In browers : JavaScript typically runs in the browser (like Chrome or FireFox) to handle frontend tasks. 

//? With Node.js :- 
//* Node.js allows JS to run outside the browser, on the server. 
//? It provides tools to interact with the system, like : 
    //! File System (read, write files) 
    //! Network (handle HTTP files) 
    //! Database (connect to databases like MongoDB or MySQL) 








//*=======================================
//* Why is Node.js Special as a Runtime ?
//*=======================================
//? V8 Engine :
    //* Node.js uses Google Chrome's V8 engine to compile JavaScript into machine code, making it lighting-fast. 

//? Built-in APIs : 
    //* Node.js comes with built-in APIs (like fs for file systems or http for server) so you can build powerful applications without extra libraries. 








//*=======================================
//* Why do we need Node.js ?
//*=======================================
//! Single language for full stack development :- 
    //? Developers can use JS for both frontend and backend, reducing complexity.
    //? For example, a MERN stack project (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)

//! High Performance :- 
    //? Thanks to the V8 engine, Node.js is super fast. 
    //? It can handle thousands of simultaneous connections with ease. 

//! Event-Driven and Non-Blocking I/O :- 
    //? Unlike traditional servers that block a thread for each request, Node.js uses an asynchronous model, making it highly efficient for handling multiple tasks. 

//! Scalable for Modern Applications :- 
    //? Ideal for real-time applications like chat apps, streaming platforms, or online games. 








//*=======================================
//* Is it a language or a Framework ?
//*=======================================
//? Node.js is not a programming language or a framework, but rather a JavaScript Runtime Environment that allows developers to run JavaScript outside of a browser.
